# Error Correction Simulator

This project explores how classical error-correcting codes can improve the reliability of digital data transmissions over noisy channels.  
It combines theoretical simulations with a practical implementation involving a Raspberry Pi and a PC communicating over Wi-Fi using raw TCP sockets.

The two coding schemes implemented are:

- Hamming Code (7,4) — fast, lightweight, ideal for simple errors
- Reed-Solomon Code (255,223) — robust, used in CDs, QR codes, and space communications


## Why this project?

In any real communication system, data can be altered by noise — whether over the air, on disk, or in memory.  
This project was born from a simple question: How can we ensure that what is received is exactly what was sent?

By simulating and then testing real transmissions with error correction, the goal was to understand:

- How errors appear and propagate
- How redundancy and structure help protect data
- How theory meets practice in embedded systems and communication protocols

## What’s inside

- A full Python simulation of a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) with adjustable noise
- Two full encoding/decoding chains: Hamming and Reed-Solomon
- A real-life transmission test over Wi-Fi, Raspberry Pi to PC (using TCP sockets)
- Visualization tools to compare performance as noise increases

## Technologies

- Python 3
- NumPy
- reedsolo (for Reed-Solomon codes)
- Socket programming (TCP)
- Matplotlib (for plots)

## How to use it

Install the dependencies:

pip install numpy reedsolo matplotlib

### To run a local simulation:

python simulate_bsc_channel.py

### To test real transmission (Raspberry Pi → PC):

1. Start a receiver_(.....).py script on the PC
2. Run the corresponding sender_(...).py script on the Pi
3. Make sure to update IP addresses and ports in the code if needed

## Example result

As the noise increases, Hamming's correction rate quickly drops, while Reed-Solomon remains effective up to ~40% noise.
